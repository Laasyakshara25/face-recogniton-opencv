# Face Detection and Recognition Using Haar Cascade

This repository provides a simple and effective implementation of **face detection** using the Haar Cascade classifier in Python with OpenCV. Additionally, it includes optional enhancements for **face recognition** and demonstrates the detection of faces.

## Overview
Haar Cascade is a machine learning-based object detection algorithm used to identify objects (e.g., faces) in an image or video based on pre-trained features. This project leverages OpenCV's implementation of Haar Cascade to detect and optionally recognize faces in real-time. 

### Installation
Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Laasyakshara25/face-recogniton-opencv.git
