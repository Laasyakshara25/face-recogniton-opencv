# Face Detection and Recognition Using Haar Cascade

This repository provides a simple and effective implementation of **face detection** using the Haar Cascade classifier in Python with OpenCV. Additionally, it includes optional enhancements for **face recognition** and demonstrates the detection of faces in real-time via webcam.

## Overview
Haar Cascade is a machine learning-based object detection algorithm used to identify objects (e.g., faces) in an image or video based on pre-trained features. This project leverages OpenCV's implementation of Haar Cascade to detect and optionally recognize faces in real-time. 

### Key Features:
- **Real-time Face Detection**: Detect faces using OpenCVâ€™s pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier.  
- **Face Recognition** (Optional): Extend the functionality by integrating a recognition module for identifying specific faces.  
- **Ease of Use**: Minimal setup and straightforward code for beginners and advanced users alike.  
- **Visualization**: Save and display images with detected faces.  

## Getting Started
