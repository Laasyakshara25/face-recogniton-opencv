Face Recognition using Haar Cascade


This repository contains a simple implementation of face detection using the Haar Cascade classifier in Python with OpenCV. Haar Cascade is a machine learning object detection algorithm used to identify objects in an image or video based on features.

Overview
This project demonstrates the use of OpenCV’s Haar Cascade classifier to detect faces in real-time from a webcam feed. The model works by scanning an image using pre-trained Haar Cascade features and detects faces.

Features
Face detection using OpenCV’s pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier.
Minimal setup and easy-to-understand code.
